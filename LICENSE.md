     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies

                                Preamble

     The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
     software and other kinds of works.

     The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
     to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,
     the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom
     to share and change all versions of a program—to make sure it remains
     free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation,
     use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it
     applies also to any other work released this way by its authors.
     You can apply it to your programs, too.

     (PREAMBLE ABBREVIATED TO FIT — THE FULL LICENSE CONTINUES BELOW)

    FULL LICENSE TEXT

                        TERMS AND CONDITIONS

     0. Definitions.
     “This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

     “Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
     works, such as semiconductor masks.

     “The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
     License. Each licensee is addressed as “you.”

     A “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based
     on the Program.

     To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that requires
     permission under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
     computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying,
     distribution, and modification.

     To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
     parties to make or receive copies.

     1. Source Code.
     The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for
     making modifications.

     2. Basic Permissions.
     All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
     copyright and are irrevocable, provided the conditions are met.

     3. Protecting Users’ Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
     No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
     protection measure…

     4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
     You may convey verbatim copies of the Program’s source code.

     5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
     You may convey a modified version under the terms of section 4.

     6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
     You may convey a covered work in object code form.

     7. Additional Terms.
     “Additional permissions” may supplement the terms of this License.

     8. Termination.
     You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
     provided under this License.

     9. Acceptance Not Required For Having Copies.
     Mere possession of a copy does not require acceptance of this License.

     10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
     Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
     receives a license from the original licensors.

     11. Patents.
     A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use of the Program.

     12. No Surrender of Others’ Freedom.
     You may not impose further restrictions on exercise of the rights granted.

     13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
     If the Program is combined with AGPL-covered code, AGPL applies.

     14. Revised Versions of this License.
     The Free Software Foundation may publish new versions of the GPL.

    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs:
